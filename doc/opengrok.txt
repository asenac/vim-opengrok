INTRODUCTION                                            *opengrok-introduction*

|vim-opengrok| allows you to navigate through your project by querying an index
created with Opengrok. However, it does not require to have an Opengrok
instance deployed running in a Tomcat server. It can use either an externally
created index, for example, created by a cron job, or an internally managed
index created and updated by using |:OgIndex| and |:OgReindex| commands
respectively.

|vim-opengrok| provides two different ways of making queries. |:OgSearch|,
|:OgSearchCWord| and |:OgSearchFile| display the results in Vim's location
list. |:OgMode| opens an special buffer with some shortcuts defined and allows
you to keep the result of several queries in the same buffer.

Another difference between |:OgMode| buffer and Vim's location list is that in
the former the search term appears highlighted in the results.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                          *opengrok-configuration*

Once you have installed |vim-opengrok| using your favorite package manager, it
requires you to add at least one line to your vimrc file to specify the
location of Opengrok's Jar file by defining |g:opengrok_jar| global variable
as follows:

    let g:opengrok_jar = '/path/to/opengrok/lib/opengrok.jar'

As stated in the introduction, |vim-opengrok| can use both internal and
external indexes. Internal indexes, index created and updated by using
|:OgIndex| and |:OgReindex| commands respectively, require you to define
|g:opengrok_ctags| in your vimrc pointing to the location of the Exuberant
Ctags exectuable as follows:

    let g:opengrok_ctags = '/path/to/ctags'

For using an externally managed index you need to speficy the location of its
configuration file with |g:opengrok_config_file|. For example, if you have
an Opengrok instance running in a Tomcat server, with a crob job configured
to update the index, and you want to make |vim-opengrok| use the same index as
Opengrok's web application, you can do it by adding the following line to your
vimrc file:

    let g:opengrok_config_file = '/var/opengrok/etc/configuration.xml'

Note: change the path above if you have installed opengrok on a different
location.
